    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am Nurul Absar, currently serving as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Port City International University(PCIU) in Chattogram, Bangladesh. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University. My research interests encompass a broad spectrum of artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on computer vision, natural language processing, and federated learning. The majority of my research is focused on leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) to address various practical challenges, particularly in the context of our local environment.

Before joining PCIU, I served as a Adjunct Lecturer at BGC Trust University Bangladesh, where I contributed sincerely through my efforts in teaching and development of curriculum. I am passionate about teaching and mentoring students, and I strive to foster a collaborative learning environment.

In addition to my teaching responsibilities, I am actively engaged in multiple research projects in collaboration with my students and peers. I am excited about the potential of technology to drive innovation and improve lives, and I am committed to contributing to this field through both my teaching and research efforts.
